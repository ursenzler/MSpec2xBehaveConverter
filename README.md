# MSpec2xBehaveConverter

Doucmentation: http://ursenzler.github.io/MSpec2xBehaveConverter

A very basic converter to help you switch from Machine.Specifications to xBehave, by doing the syntax migration for you.
The result is (in the case it works) a runnable xBehave test - not a nice one, but it should run.

The converter console application takes a single path as argument and converts this file.

## not supported (as found out so far)
* specs with base classes
